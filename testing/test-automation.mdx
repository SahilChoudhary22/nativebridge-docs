## Creating a new project
You can create a new project from scratch or import a folder or import from your github repository.

## Managing your project
Upon clicking on your project, you'll be navigated to an VSCode-like (IDE-like) interface. This is so that you have complete freedom to create, edit, and manage your spec files.

## Running the test/automation
There are multiple ways to run the spec files. First being the simplest, through the UI.

To run a single spec file, just select the spec file in your project and click on the green run button at the top of your screen.

<Note>To run multiple spec files, just select multiple files and click on the green run button. Otherwise you can just add more files in the modal that opens up when you click on run button. </Note>

The other way to run the automation is through the API or the magic link/session page.
