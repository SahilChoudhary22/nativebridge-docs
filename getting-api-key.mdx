# Getting Your API Key

API keys allow you to programmatically interact with NativeBridge, enabling you to upload apps, generate magic links, and automate your testing workflows.

<Info>
API keys are tied to your organization and have the same permissions as your user account. Keep them secure and never share them publicly.
</Info>

## Generate Your First API Key

Follow these simple steps to create your API key:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Dashboard">
    Log in to your NativeBridge account and go to your [Dashboard](https://nativebridge.io/dashboard)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access API Keys Section">
    Click on **"API Keys"** in the sidebar navigation or go directly to [API Keys](https://nativebridge.io/settings/api-keys)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New API Key">
    Click the **"Generate New API Key"** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Give your API key a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Actions", "Development", "Production")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy and Save">
    Copy your API key immediately - you won't be able to see it again once you leave the page
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important:** Your API key will only be shown once. Make sure to copy and store it securely before navigating away from the page.
</Warning>

## Visual Guide

<Frame>
</Frame>

The API Keys section in your dashboard shows:
- List of all active API keys
- When each key was created
- Last used timestamp
- Options to revoke keys

## Using Your API Key

Once you have your API key, you can use it in your API requests:

### In HTTP Headers

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nativebridge.dev/v1/apps/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -F "file=@app.apk" \
  -F "platform=android"
```

### In Environment Variables

Store your API key as an environment variable for security:

```bash
# .env file
NATIVEBRIDGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```javascript
// Node.js
const apiKey = process.env.NATIVEBRIDGE_API_KEY;

const response = await fetch('https://api.nativebridge.dev/v1/apps/upload', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
  }
});
```

### In CI/CD Pipelines

#### GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. Add a new secret named `NATIVEBRIDGE_API_KEY`
3. Use in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Upload to NativeBridge
  run: |
    curl -X POST https://api.nativebridge.dev/v1/apps/upload \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.NATIVEBRIDGE_API_KEY }}" \
      -F "file=@app.apk"
```

#### GitLab CI

1. Go to Project Settings → CI/CD → Variables
2. Add a variable named `NATIVEBRIDGE_API_KEY`
3. Use in your pipeline:

```yaml
upload_app:
  script:
    - curl -X POST https://api.nativebridge.dev/v1/apps/upload \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $NATIVEBRIDGE_API_KEY" \
        -F "file=@app.apk"
```

## Managing API Keys

### View All Keys

Your [API Keys dashboard](https://nativebridge.io/settings/api-keys) displays:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | The descriptive name you gave the key |
| Created | When the key was generated |
| Last Used | Most recent API call using this key |
| Actions | Revoke or regenerate the key |

### Revoke a Key

To revoke an API key:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://nativebridge.io/settings/api-keys)
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click the **"Revoke"** button
4. Confirm the action

<Warning>
Revoking a key immediately invalidates it. Any services using this key will lose access.
</Warning>

### Regenerate a Key

If you suspect a key has been compromised:

1. Revoke the compromised key immediately
2. Generate a new key with the same name
3. Update all services with the new key

## Best Practices

<Cards>
  <Card title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Name keys based on their purpose: "Production API", "GitHub Actions", "Local Development"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Rotate Regularly" icon="refresh">
    Rotate API keys every 90 days for enhanced security
  </Card>

  <Card title="Limit Scope" icon="shield">
    Create separate keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Never Commit Keys" icon="lock">
    Never commit API keys to version control - use environment variables instead
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Security Guidelines

### DO ✅

- Store keys in environment variables or secrets management systems
- Use different keys for different environments
- Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately
- Monitor key usage in your dashboard
- Use HTTPS for all API requests

### DON'T ❌

- Share keys in emails or chat messages
- Commit keys to git repositories
- Use the same key across multiple projects
- Expose keys in client-side code
- Log or print keys in console output

## Rate Limits by Plan

API keys inherit the rate limits of your subscription plan:

| Plan | API Calls/Hour | Concurrent Requests |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Free | 60 | 1 |
| Starter | 300 | 3 |
| Growth | 1000 | 10 |
| Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited |

<Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Key not working">
    - Ensure you're including "Bearer " before the key in the Authorization header
    - Check that the key hasn't been revoked
    - Verify you're using the correct API endpoint
    - Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't see API Keys section">
    - Verify you have the necessary permissions in your organization
    - Check if your plan includes API access
    - Contact your organization admin for access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forgot to copy key">
    - Once created, keys cannot be viewed again for security
    - You'll need to revoke the old key and create a new one
    - Make sure to update all services with the new key
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate limit exceeded">
    - Check your current plan's limits in the dashboard
    - Consider upgrading to a higher plan
    - Implement request caching and batching
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Your First API Call

Once you have your API key, try this simple test:

```bash
# Test your API key
curl -X GET https://api.nativebridge.dev/v1/account \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Expected response:
{
  "organization": "Your Organization",
  "plan": "starter",
  "api_calls_remaining": 298
}
```
