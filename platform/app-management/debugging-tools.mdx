- name: Debug Failed Tests
  if: failure()
  run: |
    native-bridge debug \
      --session-id ${{ env.SESSION_ID }} \
      --capture-logs \
      --screenshot \
      --heap-dump
```

### IDE Plugins

The debugging tools integrate with popular development environments. Please check the main platform documentation for current integration options.

## Best Practices

### Debugging Strategy

<Note>
  **Recommended Workflow**: Start with high-level logs, then progressively dive deeper using specialized tools as you narrow down the issue.
</Note>

1. **Initial Triage**: Review system logs for obvious errors
2. **Reproduce Issue**: Use session recording to capture the problem
3. **Deep Analysis**: Employ specific tools based on issue type
4. **Root Cause**: Use shell and file system access for investigation
5. **Verification**: Confirm fix using automated tests

### Security Guidelines

- Always use secure connections for ADB access
- Rotate authentication tokens regularly
- Limit debug access to development environments
- Sanitize logs before sharing externally
- Follow data protection regulations for user data

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ADB connection timeout | Check firewall settings and authentication token |
| File upload failures | Verify file size limits and storage quota |
| Shell access denied | Confirm subscription tier and permissions |
| Log streaming interruption | Check network stability and reconnect |
| File system not loading | Clear browser cache and reload session |
