## Send files to device
You can conveniently send any file to the mobile device you're working on by clicking on the 'Send files to device' button on the magic link/app page and session screen.

## Upload Another App
Sometimes there's a dependency on multiple apps or if you want to see if there's any other app interfering with your app. You can upload multiple apps in a single session and test your app.

## Access Device Shell
You can directly access the device shell for your debugging just by clicking the 'Access Device Shell' button. The level of access you get in this section is dependent on your user role as well as your plan tier.

## Access File Explorer
You can easily access the file explorer directly from the magic link/app page/session page without interacting with the device directly.

## System Logs
You get access to all levels of system logs for every device you spin up. You can also choose between different levels of logs to help with your debugging. These logs can also be downloaded later from the activity section

## Connect With ADB
This is one of the most amazing features of NativeBridge as the level of access you get to the device is equivalent to you having the physical device with you. You can directly connect with the device via ADB and use it as the phone for everything from development to QA to review processes.
