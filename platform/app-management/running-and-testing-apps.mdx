# Running Apps

## The App Page: Your Magic Link Destination

When anyone clicks a **magic link** you've shared, they're instantly taken to the **App Page** - NativeBridge's powerful, browser-based testing environment. No downloads, no installations, no setup - just immediate access to your app running on real devices in the cloud.

<Note>
**What is the App Page?**
The App Page is the interactive testing interface that opens when someone clicks your magic link. It's where your app comes to life in the browser, complete with device controls, debugging tools, and testing features.

### Via Magic Link (Primary Method)

When you upload an app and generate a magic link, anyone with the link can instantly access the App Page:

```
https://nativebridge.io/app/{appId}
```

**This is what happens when someone clicks your magic link:**
1. They're taken directly to the App Page in their browser
2. The app loads instantly on a cloud device
3. They can start testing immediately - no setup required
