# App Permissions

## Who Can Run Your App

Control access to your app through different sharing methods and permission levels.

### Magic Link Access

When you share your app via magic link, you have control over who can access it:

```
https://nativebridge.io/app/{appId}
```

By default, anyone with the magic link can run your app. This makes it easy to share with stakeholders, clients, and testers without requiring them to create accounts.

### Authenticated Access

For apps containing sensitive data, you can require users to be authenticated and linked to your organization before they can access the App Page.

## Permission Levels

NativeBridge offers flexible permission management at two levels:

<Note>Advanced permissions are only available for Starter, Growth and Custom plans</Note>

### Organization-Level Permissions

Set default permissions that apply to all apps in your organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Organization Settings">
    Go to [Organization → Session Defaults](https://nativebridge.io/organization/session-defaults)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Default Permissions">
    Set your preferred default permissions for all apps
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    These settings will apply to all new apps and existing apps without custom permissions
  </Step>
</Steps>

### App-Level Permissions

Override organization defaults with app-specific permissions:

<Warning>
App-level permissions will override organization defaults. We recommend using organization-level permissions for consistency unless you need specific exceptions.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your App">
    Navigate to your [Dashboard](https://nativebridge.io/dashboard) and select your app
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Build">
    Select the specific build you want to configure permissions for
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Go to **Settings → App Permissions** and adjust as needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
App permissions can also be configured when uploading via our REST API. See [Create new app](/rest-api/create-new-app) and [Update existing app](/rest-api/update-existing-app) for API usage.

## Available Permissions

Configure these permissions to control what features are available when someone accesses your app:

| Permission | Description | Default |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **run** | Allow running your application | ✅ Enabled |
| **networkProxy** | Specify a custom network proxy when running the app | ❌ Auth Required |
| **networkIntercept** | Use NativeBridge's intercepting proxy for network debugging | ❌ Auth Required |
| **debugLog** | View app's console output (NSLog/Logger or Logcat) | ❌ Auth Required |
| **adbConnect** | Connect ADB for Android debugging | ❌ Auth Required |
| **androidPackageManager** | Install additional APKs during app session | ❌ Auth Required |
| **deviceControl** | Access device controls (rotation, location, etc.) | ✅ Enabled |
| **mediaUpload** | Upload images/videos to the device | ✅ Enabled |
| **screenshot** | Take screenshots of the app | ✅ Enabled |

## Permission Scenarios

### Public Demo

For public demos and marketing:
- **run**: Public
- **screenshot**: Public
- **deviceControl**: Public
- All debugging features: Authenticated

### Internal Testing

For QA and development teams:
- All permissions: Authenticated
- Requires team members to sign in

### Client Review

For sharing with clients:
- **run**: Public
- **screenshot**: Public
- **deviceControl**: Public
- Technical features: Authenticated

### Beta Testing

For beta testers:
- **run**: Public with expiring links
- **screenshot**: Public
- **debugLog**: Public (for bug reports)
- Admin features: Authenticated

## Managing Access

### Revoking Access

To revoke access to a shared app:

1. **Delete the magic link** - Removes public access immediately
2. **Update permissions** - Change to authenticated-only access
3. **Upload new build** - Previous build links become invalid

### Tracking Usage

Monitor app access through:
- Usage analytics dashboard
- Access logs
- Session recordings (with permission)

## API Configuration

Configure permissions programmatically when uploading apps:

```javascript
// Upload with custom permissions
const response = await fetch('https://api.nativebridge.dev/v1/apps', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    file: appFile,
    permissions: {
      run: 'public',
      debugLog: 'authenticated',
      networkIntercept: 'authenticated',
      adbConnect: 'authenticated'
    }
  })
});
```
