<Info>
We support cross-platform apps made in Flutter, Xamarin, React-Native, Kotlin Multiplatform and others which generate `.app` or `.apk` builds.

## Upload your App

### With Upload Page

To upload your application via a web browser use our [Upload](https://nativebridge.io/upload) dialog:

<Frame>
  <iframe
    src="https://nativebridge.io/upload"
    width="100%"
    height="600px"
    style={{border: "1px solid #e5e7eb", borderRadius: "8px"}}
  />
</Frame>

#### Update existing Apps

To update an existing app, follow the same steps as uploading a new app via the [Upload](https://nativebridge.io/upload) dialog. The latest build will automatically be associated with your app.

To view all builds for an app, select the app and go to the App Builds Page.

<Warning>
In some instances, you might want to explicitly update a particular app build. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Apps Dashboard](https://nativebridge.io/apps)
2. **Select the app**
3. **Search and select the build** you want to update
4. Go to **Settings**
5. Navigate to "**Update build**"
</Warning>

### With CI/CD and Third-Party Integrations

NativeBridge integrates with several popular CI/CD tools and other third-party services, allowing you to:

* **Ensure Your App is Always Up-To-Date:**
  Automatically upload the latest builds with one of our many CI/CD integrations.
* **Eliminate Manual Processes:**
  Automate rolling out of updated apps or specific builds, saving time and effort.
* **Improve User and Development Workflows:**
  Integrate with tools such as Storybook Native and Expo to improve user and developer experiences.

### With REST API

NativeBridge also supports uploading your application programmatically by making use of our REST API:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create New App" icon="plus" href="/rest-api/create-new-app">
    Upload a new app via API
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update Existing App" icon="refresh" href="/rest-api/update-existing-app">
    Update an existing app via API
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
The **latest build** refers to the most recent version of your app on Android, identified by the [versionCode](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning#versioningsettings), and on iOS, by the [CFBundleShortVersionString](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleshortversionstring) and [CFBundleVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleversion).
