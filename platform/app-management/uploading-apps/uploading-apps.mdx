<Info>
We support cross-platform apps made in Flutter, Xamarin, React-Native, Kotlin Multiplatform and others which generate `.app` or `.apk` builds.

## Upload your App

### With Upload Page

To upload your application via a web browser use our 'Upload' dialog on the landing page or on the [App Section](https://nativebridge.io/dashboard/apps)

#### Update existing Apps

To update an existing app, follow the same steps as uploading a new app via the [Upload](https://nativebridge.io/upload) dialog. The latest build will automatically be associated with your app.

To view all builds for an app, select the app and go to the App Builds Page.

<Warning>
In some instances, you might want to explicitly update a particular app build. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Apps Dashboard](https://nativebridge.io/dashboard/apps)
2. **Select the app**
3. Click on 'Upload a new version'
4. Done
</Warning>

### With CI/CD and Third-Party Integrations

<Note>
The **latest build** refers to the most recent version of your app on Android, identified by the [versionCode](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning#versioningsettings), and on iOS, by the [CFBundleShortVersionString](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleshortversionstring) and [CFBundleVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleversion).
