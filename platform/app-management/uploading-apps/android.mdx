## Finding your APK file

### With Android Studio

Select **Build** → **Build APK(s)** → **Build APK(s)** or **Build** → **Generate Signed APK** (and follow the prompts)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build Your APK">
    Navigate to the Build menu in Android Studio and select your preferred build option
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate Your APK">
    Once the build is complete, you can locate the `.apk` file by selecting `locate` in the dialog that appears, or by navigating to:
    ```
    {project_name}/{app_module_name}/build/outputs/apk/
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### With Gradle

Generate your build with `gradle` by running the `assemble` command for your preferred app build variant (e.g. `debug` variant):

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Once the build is complete, you can locate the `.apk` file by navigating to:

```
{project_name}/{app_module_name}/build/outputs/apk/
```

## Converting AAB to APK

NativeBridge currently only supports `apk` files for Android. If you have an `aab` (Android App Bundle) file, you'll need to convert it to an `apk` using Google's [`bundletool`](https://developer.android.com/tools/bundletool).

### Generate Universal APKs

```bash
bundletool build-apks --bundle=/<your_app>/{aab_name}.aab \
    --output=/{your_app}/{app_name}.apks \
    --mode=universal
```

### Extract Single APK file

```bash
unzip -p /{your_app}/{app_name}.apks universal.apk > /{your_app}/{app_name}.apk
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble running your uploaded Android app in NativeBridge, we recommend testing the same APK on the standard Google-provided Android emulator locally over ADB.

Once your emulator is launched and available via `adb devices`, you can install it using:

```bash
adb install -r {your_app}.apk
```

Or simply drag the `apk` file into the emulator window.
