# iOS

NativeBridge currently only supports iOS Simulator builds (**.app**). A simulator build can be run in the iOS Simulator with Xcode. AppStore distribution device builds (**.ipa**) are also supported.

<Info>
For optimal performance and compatibility, we recommend uploading ARM simulator builds of your iOS app.

## Finding your .app file

### With Xcode

The easiest way to get the iOS Simulator build is to run and build your application in Xcode while targeting an iOS Simulator.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select iOS Simulator">
    Build and run your application from Xcode while targeting a simulator device from the device dropdown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Your App">
    Once the build is complete and the app is running in the simulator, you can locate the `.app` file by navigating to **Product** → **Show Build Folder in Finder** → **Products/Debug-iphonesimulator**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### With Xcode Command Line Tools

You can also generate the iOS Simulator build of your app by building it directly via the command line using `xcodebuild`.

#### With .xcodeproj

```bash
xcodebuild -project '{project_name}.xcodeproj' \
 -scheme '{scheme_name}' \
 -sdk iphonesimulator \
 -configuration Debug
```

#### With .xcworkspace

```bash
xcodebuild -workspace '{your_workspace_name}.xcworkspace' \
 -scheme '{scheme_name}' \
 -sdk iphonesimulator \
 -configuration Debug
```

The `app` file can then be found under:

```
build/Debug-iphonesimulator/
```

## Compress your .app file

Once you have located your `.app` file, NativeBridge requires it to be in a compressed `zip` or `tar.gz` file:

```bash
zip -r {app_name}.zip {app_name}.app
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble running your uploaded iOS app in NativeBridge, we recommend trying to run the same app on a simulator provided by Apple in Xcode.

Once your simulator is launched, you can simply drag the `.app` file into the simulator window to test it locally first.
